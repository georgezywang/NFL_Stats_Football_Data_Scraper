# NFL_Stats_Football_Data_Scraper
Scrapes data from NFL stats website (http://www.nfl.com/stats/categorystats?archive=false&conference=null&role=TM&offensiveStatisticCategory=GAME_STATS&defensiveStatisticCategory=null&season=2019&seasonType=REG&tabSeq=2&qualified=false&Submit=Go)


The scraper will automatically scrape data from 2005 to 2019 if no arguments is changed. To change the range of years of data to access, change the parameter of the SortNFLData in the main part of the code. The scraper will generate two files, one including all offense data named (NFL_Stats_fifteen_yearsO), and one with all defense data (NFL_Stats_fifteen_yearsO). 


Data from 2005 to 2019 are also attached to this repository.
